# Preface {-}

The purpose of this document is to define correct coding standards and project best practices to be used when developing with the tools preferred within the Data Science Campus (DSC, the Campus) at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).


When working in a scientific environment, one should always strive to make their work as reproducible as possible. This is no different when working with code and data. There are two essential reasons for this:

* to show evidence of the correctness of your results
* to enable others to make use of our methods and results

This document aims to provide guidance on how we can achieve this reproducible nirvana. For additional information, please refer to the [rOpenSci documents](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/).




The most prevalent guidance to be taken from this document is to *use your common sense*. If your code begins to look a lot like spaghetti and you are thinking "I feel sorry for the poor sap that I hand this over to" then you should go away and make it so that whoever does inherit your code, or play with it or handle it in any way won't get upset just by reading it. Our recommended methods of working are intended to make it simple to write, maintain, share and collaborate.
