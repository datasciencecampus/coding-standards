# Python

The below are the most immediate features that ONS code should be expected to adhere to. The recommendations
in [Effective Python](http://www.effectivepython.com) give a more in-depth idea of how to write good python code and align with our recommendations.


## Style guide

The following sections outline conditions on python code produced for sharing.

#### Spacing {-}
Tabs are illegal. All indentation should be in spaces and each indent should be either 2 or 4 spaces.

#### Line length {-}
No lines should exceed 80 characters. 

#### Blank lines {-}

* __1 line__: There should be one line between blocks of code, the exceptions are where two lines are recommended.
* __2 lines__: Start and end of function definitions, import blocks, headers, and class definitions should have 2 lines clearning them.
  
*Good*

```python
import os
      
      
class Goober(object):
  """|
    docstrings are good
    docstrings are great
  """
  def __init__(self):
    pass
    
 
def main():
  pass
```

*Bad*

```python
import os
class Goober(object):
  """|
    docstrings are good
    docstrings are great
  """
  def __init__(self):
    pass
    
def main():
  pass
```

#### Data declarations {-} 
Elements must align, either in leading or following comma notation. Some examples:

```python
list_1 = [
  elem_1,
  elem_2,
  elem_3
]


list_2 = [ elem_1
         , elem_2
         , elem_3
         ] 
```

#### List comprehensions {-}
There should be no more than 2 statements included in any list comprehension. If the comprehension is exceeding this length then break it out into a loop or multiple statements. It might make sense to you now but when somebody else comes to read it they will hate you if you don't.

#### Exceptions {-}
Do not raise base exceptions. Create your own classes which extend them and manage your errors correctly.

#### Imports {-}
Imports should be grouped, at the top of your file and placed in the following order.

1. standard library imports
2. related third party imports
3. local application/library specific imports

Put a blank line between each group of imports and include a comment to show the group.  The imports in each group should be sorted alphabetically, by module name.

Always use explicit import lists or `qualified` imports for standard and third party libraries.  This makes the code more robust against changes in these libraries.  Exception: The Prelude.

#### Type hinting {-} 
Where possible use [type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) as per[PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/). It will make your code more verbose, easier to debug and handle when others come to inherit it.
