# Python

The below are the most immediate features that your code should have. The recommendations in [Effective Python](http://www.effectivepython.com) give a more in-depth idea of how to write good python code and align with our recommendations.


## Style guide

The following sections outline conditions on python code produced for sharing.

#### Spacing {-}
Tabs are illegal. All indentation should be in spaces and each level of indent should be either 2 or 4 spaces, but constant throughout the project at either 2 or 4.

```{python}
import numpy as np


# Good
def main():
  """
    This is my docstring
    There are many others like it
    But this one is mine
  """
  def third_eye(n):
    return 3 * np.eye(n)
 
 
# Bad
def main():
  """
    This is my docstring
    There are many others like it
    But this one is mine
  """
  def third_eye(n):
      return 3 * np.eye(n)
```

#### Line length {-}
No lines should exceed 80 characters. If you find yourself running out of room on a line then it might be a good sign that you need to write a function. 


#### Blank lines {-}

* __1 line__: There should be one line between blocks of code, the exceptions are where two lines are recommended.
* __2 lines__: Start and end of function definitions, import blocks, headers, and class definitions should have 2 lines clearning them.


```python
# Good
import os
      
      
class Goober(object):
  """|
    docstrings are good
    docstrings are great
  """
  def __init__(self):
    pass
    
 
def main():
  pass
  
# Bad
import os
class Goober(object):
  """|
    docstrings are good
    docstrings are great
  """
  def __init__(self):
    pass
    
def main():
  pass
```

#### Data declarations {-} 
Elements must align, either in leading or following comma notation. Some examples:

```python
list_1 = [
  elem_1,
  elem_2,
  elem_3
]


list_2 = [ elem_1
         , elem_2
         , elem_3
         ] 
```

#### List comprehensions {-}
There should be no more than 2 statements included in any list comprehension. If the comprehension is exceeding this length then break it out into a loop or multiple statements. It might make sense to you now but when somebody else comes to read it they will hate you if you don't.


#### Exceptions {-}
Do not raise base exceptions. Create your own classes which extend them and manage your errors in a meaningful way.


#### Imports {-}
Imports should be grouped, at the top of your file and placed in the following order.

1. standard library imports
2. related third party imports
3. local application/library specific imports

Put a blank line between each group of imports and include a comment to show the group.  The imports in each group should be sorted alphabetically, by module name. Try to avoid `from foo import *` unless you can be absolutely certain that there are no clashes in the namespace. It may be more suitable to give your module a short alias, such as `import pandas as pd`.


#### Type hinting {-} 
Where possible use [type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) as per[PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/). It will make your code more verbose as well as easier to debug and handle.
