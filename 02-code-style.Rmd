# Programming Styles {#style}

Make pretty code.

## GitHub

All GitHub repository names should follow the `kebab-case` naming convention and be in lower case.

## R

Generally we will be sticking to [Hadley Wickham's R Style Guide](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html) for all R code we write. Some important points to note are to try to stick to 80 characters per line (exceptions are made for `.Rmd` files or similar) and to use 2 spaces, not tabs! With regards to naming conventions, some people prefer `snake_case` where as others prefer `camelCase`; generally speaking either are fine so long as you and any collaborators are consistent with your code.

### Tools

The [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package is designed to help you stick to certain coding conventions. `lintr` can be executed as standalone or as part of build. It can integrated into RStudio, emacs/ess, vim etc. Using `lintr` will ensure we are all conforming to the same coding standards. Additionally, `lintr` can be [ran as part of](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr#testthat) your [`testthat` tests](#tests).

Quick formatting to code can be applied using the [`formatR`](https://yihui.name/formatr/) package. The `formatR` package was designed to reformat R code to improve readability; the main workhorse is the function `tidy_source()`. Features include:

* long lines of code and comments are reorganized into appropriately shorter ones
* spaces and indent are added where necessary
* the number of spaces to indent the code (i.e. tab width) can be specified
* an else statement in a separate line without the leading `}` will be moved one line back
* `=` as an assignment operator can be replaced with `<-`

The [`goodpractice`](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) is useful for giving advice about good practices when [building R packages](#package). Advice includes functions and syntax to avoid, package structure, code complexity, code formatting (using `lintr`), etc.
